# Advent of code 2024
For this years Advent of code, I've picked a new programming language that I have very low experience with: Rust. 
**Warning!**
This repository contains my solutions for presented problems. I usually code this in my free time after work and school, so the code is often not optimalised. My poor knowledge of Rust and its STD is often literally screaming from the codebase :D, but I do really enjoy learning a new programming language trough solving problems and AOC is a wonderfull opportunity to do it at least once a year.
